PitchPredictionRL
PitchPredictionRL is a project that focuses on predicting the primary pitch types a pitcher tends to throw in an ongoing baseball game. It takes into account the current game situation and pitch tipping cues to make accurate predictions. Using reinforcement learning techniques, it also provides recommendations on the optimal actions a batter should take to maximize rewards when facing a particular pitch type.

Features
Pitch type prediction: Based on the available game data and pitch tipping cues, the project predicts the most likely pitch type that a pitcher will throw in the current situation.

Reinforcement learning: The project employs reinforcement learning algorithms to learn and recommend the best actions for a batter when a specific pitch type is thrown.

Reward optimization: By considering various factors such as pitch velocity, movement, and batter's performance, the project aims to guide the batter towards actions that yield the highest rewards.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PitchPredictionRL.git
Set up the virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
cd PitchPredictionRL
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the necessary data: Ensure that you have the relevant game data and pitch tipping cues available for the prediction process.

Train the model: Run the training script to train the reinforcement learning model and optimize the reward predictions.

Copy code
python train.py
Make predictions: Use the trained model to make pitch type predictions based on the current game situation and pitch tipping cues.
Copy code
python predict.py
Evaluate the performance: Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the pitch type predictions and the recommended actions for batters.
